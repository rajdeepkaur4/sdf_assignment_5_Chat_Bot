# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
- Error handling: Careful thought had to go into writing functions that deal with different kinds of mistakes, like incorrect inputs or invalid data.

- Inter-connection of functions: Planned data flow management was needed to coordinate the interactions between many operations and functions within the chatbot function.

- Mock User Input: Writing Unit test cases that cover all the possible sceanoirs to test was a bit challenging.

## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.

### Benefits
- Error detection : Unit tests make it possible to identify and troubleshoot code bugs early on, which can avert later, more serious difficulties.

- High code Quality : Unit test help ensure the code covers all the error handling and is highly written well.

### Challenges

- Covering all cases: It might be difficult to obtain complete test coverage, particularly for big codebases. Finding the right balance between avoiding over-testing and providing vital functionality is crucial.

- Testing Data: It might be difficult to generate test data, particularly for edge cases, and more code may be needed to put up test scenarios.
